# Command Line Interface in the Browser

Run shell commands from the browser, in parallel and with real-time output. You can add buttons for common commands with extra sliders or checkboxes to control the command.


## Usage

Make sure `flask` is installed (`pip install flask`).

Then run the app with:

```bash
python app.py
```

Open the browser and go to `http://localhost:5000/`.
